# Contributing to AppForge v5

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AppForge v5! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this concept iOS application.

## üéØ Project Overview

AppForge v5 is a **front-end concept** and **UI prototype** that demonstrates what an iOS app generator platform could look like. It does not actually generate applications but showcases beautiful, interactive iOS interface design.

## üöÄ How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/APPFORGE_V5_BACKUP.git
cd APPFORGE_V5_BACKUP
```

### 2. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Make Your Changes
- Follow Swift and SwiftUI best practices
- Maintain consistency with the existing code style
- Test your changes on both iPhone and iPad simulators
- Ensure dark/light mode compatibility

### 4. Test Your Changes
- Build and run the project in Xcode
- Test on different device sizes
- Verify animations and transitions work smoothly
- Check that notifications and interactions function properly

### 5. Submit a Pull Request
- Provide a clear description of your changes
- Include screenshots or screen recordings if UI changes are involved
- Reference any related issues

## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### SwiftUI Best Practices
- Use `@StateObject` for view models in parent views
- Use `@ObservedObject` for view models passed down to child views
- Keep views small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Animation Guidelines
- Use spring animations for natural feel: `.easeInOut`, `.spring()`
- Keep animation durations reasonable (0.3-0.8 seconds)
- Ensure animations are performant and don't cause frame drops

### Color System
- Use colors from `AppForgeColors.swift`
- Maintain consistency with the existing color palette
- Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility
